=============================
Numbers used in UPenn slides
=============================

leader election (using function symbols, btw relation, and not putting "leader(X) -> idn(Y)<=idn(X)" in the original safety property):
sorts: 2 - node, id
relations and function symbols (counting only btw and not ring.le): 5 - ring.btw, le, leader, pending, idn
number of literals in safety property: 3
number of literals in invariant: 9
number of CTI iterations : 3

learning switch (with route.dom, hosts and switches are both nodes):
sorts: 2 - node, packet
relations and function symbols: 6 - route.tc, route.dom, pending, src, dst, link
number of literals in safety property: 11 (the conjectures that come from the module)
number of literals in invariant: 15 (not counting the conjectures that come from the module)
number of CTI iterations : 5

database chain replication (version of artifact evaluation, not using functoin symbols):
sorts: 4
relations and function symbols: 13
number of literals in safety property: 11
number of literals in invariant: 35
number of CTI iterations : 7

chord (version of artifact evaluation, not using functoin symbols):
sorts: 1
relations and function symbols: 13 (counting defined and derived relations)
number of literals in original conjecture set: 35
number of literals in final invariant: 46
number of CTI iterations: 4 (two weaken and two strengthen)

concensus unanimously (contrived protocol, very simple, the second attempt with better invariant not counting the less general clause):
sorts: 2
relations: 5
number of literals in original conjecture set: 5
number of literals in final invariant: 9
number of CTI iterations: 2

concensus quorum (I think this is a single round of Paxos):
sorts: 3
relations and function symbols: 7 (including the Skolem function quorum_intersection)
number of literals in original conjecture set: 5
number of literals in final invariant: 13
number of CTI iterations: 3
